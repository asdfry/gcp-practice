Q21. Your company's user-feedback portal comprises a standard LAMP stack replicated across two zones.

The portal meets a 99,99% availability SLA under these conditions. However next quarter, your company will be making the portal available to all users, including unauthenticated users. You need to develop a resiliency[h] testing strategy to ensure the system maintains the SLA once they introduce additional user load.
What should you do?


A. Capture existing users input, and replay captured user load until autoscale is triggered on all layers. At the same time, terminate all resources in one of the zones
B. Create synthetic[i] random user input, replay synthetic load until autoscale logic is triggered on at least one layer, and introduce 'chaos' to the system by terminating random resources on both zones
C. Expose the new system to a larger group of users, and increase group size each day until autoscale logic is triggered on all layers. At the same time, terminate random resources on both zones
D. Capture existing users input, and replay captured user load until resource utilization crosses 80%. Also, derive estimated number of users based on existing user's usage of the app, and deploy enough resources to handle 200% of expected load


SLA in question is about Availability (The portal meets a 99,99% availability SLA under these conditions.) therefore maintaining SLA means Availability. It's a user-feedback portal and the type of user input is going to be similar or same (A is capturing the user input and replaying it). ➜ A 정답
